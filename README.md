# Logalerts
Logalerts is an adhoc framework created to address the need to quickly alert on events contained in log files. The framework is intended
to strike a balance between being extremely flexible and also quick to adapt to various log formats and types of alerts. I created this
to be able to leverage my existing Python knowledge in lieu of learning the query langauge/syntax of a more heavyweight, full featured log
aggregation product. Writing your own python code is required to make use of the framework.

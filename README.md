# Logalerts
Logalerts is an adhoc framework originally created to address a need to quickly begin alerting on events contained in log files. 

The framework is intended to strike a balance between flexibility in what is required to create an alert and agility in how quickly an alert 
can be created. I created this to be able to leverage my existing Python knowledge in lieu of learning the query langauge/syntax of a more 
heavyweight, full featured log aggregation product. Writing your own python code is required to make use of the framework.
